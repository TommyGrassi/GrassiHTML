    <h2><strong>Company Background</strong></h2>
    <p>A sustainable corporation established in New Hampshire with the objective of addressing the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goal 2: ending world hunger. Established by CEO Cameron Bennett in 2011, this organization has maintained its focus and grown immensely. The primary objectives of the organization are to advance sustainable food systems, assist regional farmers, and ensure everyone has access to nutritious meals at affordable costs. The corporation began by marketing organic produce from nearby farms in the initial stages and has since expanded its product line to include sustainable food products, eco-friendly packaging, and educational programs on sustainable agriculture. Today, we offer a variety of services that seek to advance the work being done to solve this global issue within the state of New Hampshire. In New Hampshire, many low-income families struggle to pay for wholesome meals. At NH Meals, we strive to fix this problem and assist our neighboring communities.</p>
