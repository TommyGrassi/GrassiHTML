  <h1>Policies and State Guidelines</h1>
  <div class="content-section">
    <h2><strong>Financial Policies</strong></h2>
    <p><strong>1. Payment Methods:</strong> Credit cards, debit cards, and online payment systems are just a few of the different payment options accepted by NH Meals. Bitcoin is not accepted here. By using encrypted payment gateways, we give the security of our customers' financial information top priority.</p>
    <p><strong>2. Pricing and Discounts:</strong> Fair market value serves as the foundation for our transparent pricing. We provide affordable prices without sacrificing quality. To thank our devoted customers, we occasionally offer exclusive discounts and promotions on a few products.</p>
    <p><strong>3. Refunds and Cancellations:</strong> NH Meals has a refund policy in place for cancelled orders. If a cancellation is made within the allotted time, customers may ask for a refund. It might take a few business days for the refund to appear in the customer's account after it has been processed using the original payment method.</p>

    <h2><strong>Delivery Policies</strong></h2>
    <p><strong>1. Delivery Options:</strong> In order to guarantee that our customers receive their orders on time, NH Meals provides convenient delivery options. For urgent orders, we offer both standard and expedited delivery.</p>
    <p><strong>2. Delivery Areas:</strong> Currently, we cover the whole of New Hampshire. However, there might not be many delivery options in some isolated areas. During the checkout process, customers can check whether delivery is available to their specific location.</p>
    <p><strong>3. Delivery Charges:</strong> Depending on the order's value, the destination, and the delivery method selected, delivery fees might be assessed. When checking out, the applicable delivery costs are conspicuously displayed so that customers can review and confirm them before placing their orders.</p>
